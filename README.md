### Logic:
As we were instructed that we do not have to take input from the user, I have taken the data provided in the problem statement and stored it in array data structures.
I have taken 4 arrays, an array of strings to store the name of the products, 3 array of integers to store cost, gst and quantity of the products.

I have made two fucntions , one for calculating the maximum gst amount paid by the user and second for calulating the total amount paid by the user to the shopkeeper afte all the discount and gst.

(The code file also contains output of the problem statement, It has been commented out at the bottom).
